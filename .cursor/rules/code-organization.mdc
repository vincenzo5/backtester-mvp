# Code Organization Standards (Priority 2)

## Directory Structure
- Source code in `src/backtester/` package
- Tests in `tests/` directory (mirroring src structure)
- Utility scripts in `scripts/` organized by purpose (data/, diagnostics/, setup/, deployment/, tests/)
- Configuration in `config/` as YAML files
- Documentation in `docs/` directory
- Runtime artifacts in `artifacts/logs/`, `artifacts/reports/`, `artifacts/performance/`

## Import Standards
- Use absolute imports from `backtester.` package
- Import structure: standard libs → third-party → local imports

## Naming Conventions
- Python files: snake_case (`cache_manager.py`, `gap_filler.py`)
- Config files: snake_case with `.yaml` extension
- Class names: PascalCase (`BaseStrategy`, `ConfigManager`)
- Function/method names: snake_case
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
